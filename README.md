# metabf
R package to perform Bayesian meta analysis on GWAS summary statistics.

##To install:
You will need to install the `devtools` and `MASS` packages from CRAN. The former is needed to install from Github, while the latter has functions that this package relies on. From there, all you need to do is type
```R
library("devtools")
install_github("trochet/metabf")
```
and you should be away.
